## üêæ About MeowsDAO  

MeowsDAO is a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** built for holders of the **MeowDevs NFT Collection**. It allows members to collectively make governance decisions and invest in NFT collections as a group.  

DAOs, like MeowsDAO, democratize decision-making. Any member can create proposals, and all members can vote on them. Proposals have a voting deadline, and decisions are implemented based on the majority vote (**YES** or **NO**).

In MeowsDAO, membership is exclusive to holders of **MeowDevs NFTs**, granting them voting power and access to treasury funds.

## üéØ How It Works  

1. **Membership**  
   Holders of **MeowDevs NFTs** automatically become members of MeowsDAO.  

2. **Treasury**  
   The DAO is funded by ETH collected from the sale of **MeowDevs NFTs**.  

3. **Proposals and Voting**  
   Members can create proposals to use the treasury for purchasing NFTs from marketplaces.  
   - Each proposal has a voting period.  
   - Members vote **YES** or **NO** on the proposal.  
   - Proposals passing the majority vote are executed.  

4. **Profits**  
   If NFTs purchased by the DAO are sold for a profit, the profits can be distributed among members.
